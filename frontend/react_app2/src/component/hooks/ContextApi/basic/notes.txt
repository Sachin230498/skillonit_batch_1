// Imagine you have a React app with many components.

// You want to share data (like theme, user info, or language) across these components.

// Without Context, you’d have to pass props manually through every level (prop drilling), which is messy.

// // 💡 Context API solves this by creating a central store of data that any component can access directly, without passing props through every level.


// 🛠 Key Parts of Context API
// Part	What it does
// 1. createContext()	Creates a new context (like a “box” to store data).
// 2. Provider	A component that provides the data to all child components.
// 3. useContext()	A hook to consume the data inside any component.



// 🔑 Key Fixes:

// ✅ Use children prop (not Children).
// ✅ Use <MyContext.Provider> not <DataProvider.Provider>.
// ✅ Keep context variable name consistent (MyContext).
// ✅ Wrap components with <DataProvider> in App.js.
