// Story: I am not good at maths, so i am asking superman to help me.

function superman(a, b) {
  console.log("The Addition is", a + b);
}

//please can you tell me what is the answer of 10+10
superman(50, 50);
superman(10, 50);
superman(100, -100); 

//superman is intelligent, taken help from parameters
// what ever i want to pass inside the function, i will pass it as parameters while calling the function.
